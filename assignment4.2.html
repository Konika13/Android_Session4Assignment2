             Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML,
              CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them 
              directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used
               to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly 
               be aware of how the field is developing.
